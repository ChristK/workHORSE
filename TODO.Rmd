# Reduce size of POP and memory footprint
- DONE. Store int cols as int and not double (```View(transpose(POP[, lapply(.SD, pryr::object_size)], keep.names = "rn")[, V1 := V1/1024^2])```). Ensure that c++ side gets the col type it is expecting.
- Pass a seed for random number instead of the column to the c++ side.
- Check whether disease status needs to be stored in .fst for the initial synthpop. I.e. it may get recalculated for the baseline scenario 

# Improve epi engine
- Consider smoothing PARF and fatality rates

# Outputs
- Export costs for each disease separately

# GUI
- scenario selection in effectiveness tab is occassionally stops working
