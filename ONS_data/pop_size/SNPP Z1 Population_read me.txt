Notes
1.  Long-term subnational population projections are an indication of the future trends in population by age and sex over the next 25 years. They are trend-based projections, which means assumptions for future levels of births, deaths and migration are based on observed levels over the previous 5 years. They show what the population will be if recent trends continue.
2.  The projected resident population of an area includes all people who usually live there, whatever their nationality.  People moving into or out of the country are only included in the resident population if their total stay in that area is for 12 months or more, thus visitors and short-term migrants are not included. Armed forces stationed abroad are not included, but armed forces stationed within an area are included. Students are taken to be resident at their term-time address.
3.  The projections generally do not take into account any policy changes that have not yet occurred, nor those that have not yet had an impact on observed trends. They are constrained at the national level to the 2016-based national population projections published on 26 October 2017.
4.  These projections published on 24 May 2018 are based on the "Revised Population Estimates for England and Wales: mid-2012 to mid-2016" published on 22 March 2018.
5.  These data are based on administrative geographic boundaries in place on the reference date of 30 June 2016.
6.  Further advice on the appropriate use of these data can be obtained by emailing our Stakeholder Engagement Team (pop.info@ons.gov.uk) or telephoning +44 (0)1329 444661.

Because of rounding, figures may not sum.
