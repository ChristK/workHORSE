## Instalation
The current version of workHORSE only supports Linux. Windows users will have to manually change the paths.  

workHORSE uses some large R objects that cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to their size. After you clone the GitHub repo please download the data files from (https://filedn.com/lj14yWNHbMFXQ0F4Fkti6a8/workHORSE_data_files) and untar them to your local workHORSE folder.

We will release soon a Docker image to make installation of workHORSE straight forward
